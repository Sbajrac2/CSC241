# Home Automation System in Java

# Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of a home automation system in Java, incorporating key concepts such as inheritance, XML file reading, data structures (linked list, stack, queue, binary search tree), a simple database using HashMap, and Java Streams for generating reports. The system models sensor devices, rooms, buildings, customers, and readings.

# Inheritance
The project utilizes the concept of inheritance, allowing new classes to acquire properties from existing classes. This design approach simplifies development and promotes good program design.

# XML File Reader
An XML file reader is implemented to build objects for devices and their associated readings. The reader can construct individual Device, Room, and Reading objects. Additionally, it supports the creation of collections of Customer, Building, Room, Device, and Reading objects from XML files.

# Data Structures
The project employs various data structures:

1. Linked List: Used for managing collections of objects efficiently.
1. Stack and Queue: Implemented to handle data in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) and first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner, respectively.
1. Binary Search Tree: Created for efficient searching, removal, and traversal of objects.

# Simple Database
A simple database of devices is implemented using a HashMap as the underlying data structure. This allows for quick retrieval and storage of device information.

# Java Streams
Java Streams are leveraged to produce insightful reports about device information and customers. This functional programming approach simplifies data processing and report generation.
